### Description

<sub>This app is to help people to easily generate a webpage with info of team members. Users can input info with command line to create a team profile in a webpage. It reinforced my knowledge of Inquirer and Node.js. Bootstrap was used to establish main app frame and style, and a customized stylesheet was added to polish minor areas.</sub>
